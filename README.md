# Data-Mining-Project
This project is to profiling customers in a self-service coin laundry shop.

# Introduction
With the aid of the lecturer, we are provided with a dataset named LaundryData.csv that contains 19
attributes showing customers appearance and behaviour in a self-service coin laundry shop. Luckily, by referring to data.gov.my. (2019) we have also found a supplementary dataset that contains some information about the daily rainfall amount for each state from 2014 until 2020. In this project, we must provide some interesting analysis utilising data mining techniques in conjunction with the data provided and acquired. The result will deployed & hosted on Heroku.

# Motivation
Gathering data allows businesses to make more informed decisions on a regular basis. Data mining is crucial for recognizing patterns in customer habits or business needs. For example, keeping consistent data can provide information on when inventory will need to be replaced or understand when more staffing is needed to address consistent periods of higher customer volume. With data mining, businesses are better able to understand their demographic, develop personalized ads, and generate offers and incentives that will interest them most.

# Questions
1. Which is the top washer_no and dryer_no used by the customer?
2. When is the most popular period of a day that the customer visited the most?
3. Which day in a week has the highest sales based on the number of customers?
4. What are the peak hours that customers visit the self-service laundry shop?
5. What is the distribution of gender based on customer race?
6. What is the distribution of the basket size based on basket colour?
7. Which washer and dryer were often used together?
8. Did daily rainfall information and day impact the sales of the laundry shop?
9. What kind of relationships are there between all the attributes?
10. What are the Top-10 and Bottom-10 features based on ‘parts_of_day’ attributes?
11. What are the Top-10 and Bottom-10 features based on ‘Basket_Size’ attributes?
12. How well performed are the classification models in predicting attributes called ‘parts_of_day’
and “Basket_Size?
13. How well performed are the regression models in predicting attributes called
‘Number_Customers’?
14. How many clusters are there in the dataset?

# Benefits of this study
